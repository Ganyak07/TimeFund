# Time-Locked Collaborative Fund Smart Contract

## Overview
The Time-Locked Collaborative Fund is a Clarity smart contract designed for the Stacks blockchain that enables secure, collaborative fund management with time-locked releases and milestone-based progress tracking. This contract implements a democratic approach to fund management where participants can pool their STX tokens and collectively decide on fund releases based on achieved milestones.

## Features
- **Secure Fund Pooling**: Participants can deposit STX tokens into a shared pool
- **Time-Lock Mechanism**: Funds are locked for a minimum period (default: 10 days)
- **Democratic Governance**: Weighted voting system based on contribution amounts
- **Milestone Tracking**: Progress tracking with validator verification
- **Transparent Management**: All transactions and decisions are recorded on-chain
